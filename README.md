# Java Path Finder Gradle Plugin

This is a gradle plugin that makes it easier to use [Java Path Finder](https://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf) (JPF)
from within a gradle project without having to install JPF or configure a jpf.properties with your projects classpath.

## Usage
Add this plugin in your gradle build using the [configuration](https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/com.github.upthewaterspout.jpf) from plugins.gradle.org.


By default this plugin will download JPF
to a .jpf directory within the root of your project, add jpf.jar to your
testCompile classpath, and generate a jpf.properties file that contains
classpath and sourcepath variables generated from your projects configuration

### Example build file

See the [jpf-gradle-sample](https://github.com/upthewaterspout/jpf-gradle-sample) project for an an example
of how to use this plugin in your project.
```
plugins {
  id "com.github.upthewaterspout.jpf" version "0.3"
}

jpf {
}
```

#### Optional Configuration
```
plugins {
  id "com.github.upthewaterspout.jpf" version "0.3"
}

jpf {
    //The version of jpf to download
    downloadUrl='https://babelfish.arc.nasa.gov/trac/jpf/raw-attachment/wiki/projects/jpf-core/jpf-core-r32.zip'

    //The directory to install jpf into
    installDir=".jpf"

    //Additional properties to add to jpf.properties
    properties=['cg.enumerate_random': 'true', 'race.exclude': 'java.*']

}
```

## TODO

- Mirror jpf-core somewhere
- Allow downloading other jpf components
- Figure out how to configure the classpath to use IDE classes directories, if possible.
